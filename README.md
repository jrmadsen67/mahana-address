==============

Php (technically CodeIgniter, but should work anywhere) library to quickly create formatted addresses from db row

Will accept a row as either an array or object, read the address-related values, and format them into a label - without all the ickey, boring work.

Please read http://codebyjeff.com/blog/2012/10/no-more-boring-address-formatting for full details on how this works.
